# Choose an Editor

My recommendations for an editor for Angular 2 are as follows. Both 
are excellent choices. I personally use WebStorm as a more full-featured 
IDE, but Visual Studio Code is excellent and quickly becoming the
popular choice.

## Free
Visual Studio Code

## Paid
WebStorm ($59 for personal license)

Other JetBrains IDEs also have all of WebStorm's features: IntelliJ, 
Rubymine, PyCharm, and PhpStorm.
